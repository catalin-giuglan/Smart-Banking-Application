# Smart Banking Application

## Overview

Smart Banking Application is a Java-based application designed to provide users with a seamless and secure banking experience. This application offers various banking features, such as account management, transaction processing, and financial analytics.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with password encryption.
- **Account Management**: Create, update, and delete bank accounts.
- **Transaction Processing**: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
- **Financial Analytics**: View transaction history and generate financial reports.

## Implementation

The Smart Banking Application is built using Java, ensuring a robust, scalable, and object-oriented solution. Below are the key components and their implementations:

- **Model**: The data structure and business logic of the application are encapsulated within the model layer. This includes classes representing bank accounts, users, transactions, and other entities. The model is responsible for maintaining the state and enforcing business rules.
  - Example classes: `User`, `BankAccount`, `Transaction`.

- **Controller**: The controller layer handles user inputs and updates the model accordingly. It processes incoming HTTP requests, invokes the appropriate services, and returns responses. The controller acts as an intermediary between the view and the model.
  - Example classes: `UserController`, `AccountController`, `TransactionController`.

- **Services**: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It interacts with the model and performs operations such as validating user input, processing transactions, and generating reports.
  - Example classes: `UserService`, `AccountService`, `TransactionService`.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the application.
