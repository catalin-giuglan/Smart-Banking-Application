# Smart Banking Application

## Overview

Smart Banking Application is a Java-based application designed to provide users with a seamless and secure banking experience. This application offers various banking features, such as account management, transaction processing, and financial analytics.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with password encryption.
- **Account Management**: Create, update, and delete bank accounts.
- **Transaction Processing**: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
- **Financial Analytics**: View transaction history and generate financial reports.

## Implementation

The Smart Banking Application is built using Java, ensuring a robust, scalable, and object-oriented solution. Below are the key components and their implementations:

- **Model**: The data structure and business logic of the application are encapsulated within the model layer. This includes classes representing bank accounts, users, transactions, and other entities.
  - Example classes: `User`, `BankAccount`, `Transaction`.

- **Controller**: The controller layer handles user inputs and updates the model accordingly. It processes incoming HTTP requests, invokes the appropriate services, and returns responses. The controller layer is responsible for managing the application's interaction with the users.
  - Example classes: `UserController`, `AccountController`, `TransactionController`.

- **Services**: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It interacts with the model and performs operations such as validating user input, processing transactions, and generating financial reports.
  - Example classes: `UserService`, `AccountService`, `TransactionService`.

## Design Patterns

The Smart Banking Application leverages several design patterns to ensure the code is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. Below are the key design patterns used:

- **Builder Pattern**: The Builder pattern is used for constructing complex objects incrementally. For example, the `Utilizator`, `Cont`, and `Actiuni` classes use the Builder pattern to create instances with optional parameters. This makes the construction process more readable and flexible.
  - Example: `Utilizator` class

- **Factory Pattern**: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. The `Commands` class uses this pattern to instantiate various command objects based on the input.
  - Example: `Commands` class

- **Observer Pattern**: The Observer pattern is used to create a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen to and react to events. In this project, the pattern can be used to notify users about changes in their account balances or transactions.
  - Example: Implementation details would typically include methods to add, remove, and notify observers.

- **Command Pattern**: The Command pattern is used to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. The `Command` class defines an interface for executing operations, and various command classes (e.g., `CreateUser`, `AddFriend`) implement this interface.
  - Example: `CreateUser` command

These design patterns contribute to the robustness and flexibility of the Smart Banking Application, making it easier to extend and maintain.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the application.
